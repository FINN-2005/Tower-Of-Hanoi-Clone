# Tower-Of-Hanoi-Clone

## Overview

This is a classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle game implementation. I developed this project to provide a digital version of this well-known logic puzzle. The game features simple graphics.

## Key Features

* Classic Tower of Hanoi gameplay mechanics.
* Simple graphical representation of the towers and disks.
* Uses Pygame-CE for graphics and event handling.

## Prerequisites

This project requires Pygame-CE to be installed.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Tower of Hanoi game repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FINN-2005/Tower-Of-Hanoi-Clone.git
    cd Tower-Of-Hanoi-Clone
    ```

2.  **Install Pygame-CE:**

    ```bash
    pip install pygame-ce
    ```

## How to Run

1.  Navigate to the project directory (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    cd Tower-Of-Hanoi-Clone
    ```

2.  Run the game:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Important Notes

* This project uses Pygame-CE, which is a community driven fork of the original Pygame.
